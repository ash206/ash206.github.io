            <p class="book-description">It was by pure chance that Wen Yifan became housemates with Sang Yan, whom she had rejected during high school.<br>Normally, they lived their lives separately, as if they were two strangers living under the same roof.<br>But the peace was disrupted one morning.<br>The night before, Wen Yifan was still sleeping in her room, but she found herself waking in Sang Yan’s bed the next day.<br>Aware that she sleepwalked from time to time, Wen Yifan could only apologize and put it away as her fault.<br> However, when the situation repeated again and again, she tried to suggest locking his door before he heads to sleep.<br>Sang Yan dismissed the idea, saying, “You’d just pick the lock.”<br>Wen Yifan tried her best to keep her composure.<br> “Why in the world would I be able to do that?”<br>“Well…” Sang Yan lifted his eyes and drawled, “is there anything you wouldn’t do to climb onto my bed?”<br>After an awkward pause, Wen Yifan smiled. “OK, then go ahead and try.”<br>Now that caught Sang Yan by surprise.</p>
